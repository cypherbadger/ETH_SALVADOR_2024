🌋 ## ETH Volcano - Official Website 🌋

ETH Salvador 2024 Repository: Join us in shaping the first major Ethereum and Web3 community event in El Salvador, the land of Bitcoin. We're building the website for this groundbreaking event in San Salvador, March 9, 2024. Get involved, contribute, and be part of the team. Active collaborators will receive special recognition at the event. Let's make history together!

🙏 Special thanks to DAOcember for providing this OpenSource template to launch the conference webpage and for enabling us to build it publicly. ❤️

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Downloading Twitter avatars

It's safer to serve images locally. Avoiding CORS issues and privacy blockers.

To download images and use their local paths, run:

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/downloadAvatars.mts app/resources/[FILENAME]].json
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
